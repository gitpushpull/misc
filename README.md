# Introduction
This repository is a collection of various Python scripts solving random programming problems that I have encountered across the web.
Anybody is welcome to fork this repo, make changes and submit a PR.
If you want to solve a problem, please check if the problem has been solved before and update the existing script.
If possible, please add proper unit tests, using Python's `unittest` framework.
